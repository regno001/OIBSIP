      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>
        Ratan Naval Tata, born on December 28, 1937, was one of India’s most visionary 
        industrialists and philanthropists. Under his leadership, the Tata Group transformed 
        into a global powerhouse, acquiring brands like Jaguar Land Rover, Corus Steel, and 
        Tetley Tea. Beyond business, he championed ethical leadership, innovation, and social 
        welfare through the Tata Trusts, impacting millions of lives in education, healthcare, 
        and rural development.

      <p>
        Even with his immense success, he remained humble, respected, and deeply loved by 
        the nation. His passing on October 9, 2024, marks the end of an era, but his legacy 
        of integrity, compassion, and progress will continue to inspire generations.
